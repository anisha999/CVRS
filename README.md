Vaxines.COM
---------------------------------
INTRODUCTION:
We are doing a project on Child Vaccination Reminder System. There is a vast need for this tool. Vaccinations protect children from serious illness and complications of vaccine-preventable diseases.Vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles, mumps, and whooping cough, are still a threat.Outbreaks of preventable diseases occur when many parents decide not to vaccinate their children.
This proposed system enables users to keep track of their child's vaccination schedule. Parents (users) can view their child details and future vaccination dates.
